### What is an Orchestrator?

An orchestrator is a tool or system that manages the coordination and execution of complex workflows, tasks, or processes across distributed systems.  
It ensures that the individual tasks in a workflow are executed in the right order, at the right time, and under the right conditions.

Orchestrators are commonly used in domains like:

- Data engineering (ETL/ELT pipelines)
- Microservices (service communication and automation)
- Container management (Kubernetes for orchestrating containers)
- Workflow automation (task scheduling and dependency management)
